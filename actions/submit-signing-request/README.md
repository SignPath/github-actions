Github Action `submit-signing-request` to submit a signing request to [SignPath.io](https://about.signpath.io).

# Prerequisites

The _Github Actions Trusted Build System_ must be enabled in the organization and linked to the respective project. See the [SignPath documentation](https://about.signpath.io/redirects/connectors/trusted-build-system-configuration). Note that the used artifact configuration must have a `zip-file` element at its root, as all artifacts are packaged as ZIP archives on GitHub by default.

| `github-artifact-id`                          | :heavy_check_mark: | Id of the Github Actions artifact. Must be uploaded using the [actions/upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) v4+ action before it can be signed. Use `{{ steps.<step-id>.outputs.artifact-id }}` from the preceding actions/upload-artifact action step.
| `wait-for-completion`                         | -                  | If true, the action will wait for the signing request to complete. Defaults to `true`.
| `output-artifact-directory`                   | -                  | Path to where the signed artifact will be extracted. If not specified, the task will not download the signed artifact from SignPath.

Defaults to the [`secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication). Requires the `action:read` and `content:read` permissions.
| `wait-for-completion-timeout-in-seconds`      | -                  | Maximum time in seconds that the action will wait for the signing request to complete. Defaults to 10 minutes.

| `parameters`                                  | -                  | Multiline-string of values that map to user-defined parameters in the Artifact Configuration. Use one line per parameter with the format `<name>: "<value>"` where `<value>` needs to be a valid JSON string.

# Samples

#### Sign published artifact and download the signed artifact back to the build agent file system

```yaml
steps:
- id: optional_step_id
  uses: signpath/github-action-submit-signing-request@v1.1
      with:
        api-token: '${{ secrets.SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN }}'
        organization-id: '<SignPath organization id>'
        project-slug: '<SignPath project slug>'
        signing-policy-slug: '<SignPath signing policy slug>'
        github-artifact-id: '${{steps.<upload-artifact-step-id>.outputs.artifact-id}}'
        wait-for-completion: true
        output-artifact-directory: '<Destination path for the signed artifact>'
        parameters: |
          Version: ${{ toJSON(vars.version) }}
          Release_Tag: "v1.0"
```

#### Sign published artifact and continue workflow execution (do not download the signed artifact)

```yaml
steps:
- id: optional_step_id
  uses: signpath/github-action-submit-signing-request@v1.1
      with:
        api-token: '${{ secrets.SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN }}'
        organization-id: '<SignPath organization id>'
        project-slug: '<SignPath project slug>'
        signing-policy-slug: '<SignPath policy slug>'
        github-artifact-id: '${{steps.<upload-artifact-step-id>.outputs.artifact-id}}'
        wait-for-completion: false
```

## Use output parameters

The action supports the following output parameters:
- `signing-request-id`: The id of the newly created signing request
- `signing-request-web-url`: The url of the signing request in SignPath
- `signpath-api-url`: The base API url of the SignPath API
- `signed-artifact-download-url`: The url of the signed artifact in SignPath

You can use the output parameters in the following way:
```yaml
    steps:
    - name: Print the signing request id
      run:  echo "Output [${{steps.<submit_signing_request_step_id>.outputs.signing-request-id }}]"
```
