# SignPath `github-action-submit-signing-request`

This repository contains the Github Action `submit-signing-request` that can be used to submit a signing request to [SignPath.io](https://about.signpath.io).

> [!WARNING]
> This action is currently in development and only available in preview for selected customers. Contact [support@signpath.io](mailto:support@signpath.io) if you are interested in using it.

## Prerequisite

The _Github Actions Trusted Build System_ must be enabled in the organization and linked to the respective project. See the respective [SignPath documentation](https://about.signpath.io/redirects/connectors/trusted-build-system-configuration). Note that the used artifact configuration must have a `zip-file` element at its root, as all artifacts are packaged as ZIP archives on GitHub by default.

## Action parameters

Defaults to the [`secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication). See [Token permissions](#token-permissions) section below.

## Validations

### Basic validation

SignPath performs a basic set of checks to verify that the signed artifact was built from the expected repository.

### Extended validation

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently only available for selected Enterprise customers. Contact [support@signpath.io](mailto:support@signpath.io) if you are interested in using it.

SignPath can perform additional validations to ensure the security of the build pipeline.

The following validations are currently supported:

#### Runner validations

Restricts all workflow jobs leading to the signed artifact to run on runners from a defined set of runner groups.

#### Branch ruleset validations

Ensures that certain branch rules are enforced on GitHub.

* Bypassers of the ruleset can be restrited.
* Optionally, continous enforcement of the rules from a specified date can be validated. _Note: Full functionality only available for GitHub Enterprise subscriptions._

The following [branch ruleset rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/available-rules-for-rulesets) are currently supported:

* Restrict creations
* Restrict updates
* Restrict deletions:
* Require linear history
* Require signed commits
* Block force pushes
* Require code scanning results (with configurable security alerts and alerts threshold for each tool)

### Token permissions

#### `github-token`

The `github-token` is used for [basic validation](#basic-validation) and for downloading the artifact to SignPath.io .This token will be stored (encrypted) on SignPath.io, and should be short-lived with minimal permissions. It is recommended to use the default `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`.

The permissions of the `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` are set to `permissive` (default) or `restricted` in the repository, organization or enterprise. See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) for more details. In the latter case, the `action.read` and `content:read` permissions need to be explicitly set in the workflow definition for the respective job using the following snippet:

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    permissions:
      content: read
      action: read
```

#### `github-extended-verification-token`

The `github-extended-verification-token` is used if the `github-token` does not have sufficient permissions for performing [extended validations](#extended-validation). This token is only used temporarily and will not be stored on SignPath.io.

It requires the _Repository metadata read_ permission and, for GitHub Enterprise subscriptions that check the validity of those rules in the past, the _Get the audit log for an enterprise_ permission.

#### Extended validation



## Samples

### Sign published artifact and download the signed artifact back to the build agent file system

```yaml
steps:
- id: optional_step_id
  uses: signpath/github-action-submit-signing-request@v0.4
      with:
        api-token: '${{ secrets.SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN }}'
        organization-id: '<SignPath organization id>'
        project-slug: '<SignPath project slug>'
        signing-policy-slug: '<SignPath signing policy slug>'
        github-artifact-id: '${{steps.<upload-artifact-step-id>.outputs.artifact-id}}'
        wait-for-completion: true
        output-artifact-directory: '<Destination path for the signed artifact>'
        parameters: |
          Version: ${{ toJSON(vars.version) }}
          Release_Tag: "v1.0"
```

### Sign published artifact and continue workflow execution (do not download the signed artifact)

```yaml
steps:
- id: optional_step_id
  uses: signpath/github-action-submit-signing-request@v0.4
      with:
        api-token: '${{ secrets.SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN }}'
        organization-id: '<SignPath organization id>'
        project-slug: '<SignPath project slug>'
        signing-policy-slug: '<SignPath policy slug>'
        github-artifact-id: '${{steps.<upload-artifact-step-id>.outputs.artifact-id}}'
        wait-for-completion: false
```

### Use output parameters

The action supports the following output parameters:
- `signing-request-id`: The id of the newly created signing request
- `signing-request-web-url`: The url of the signing request in SignPath
- `signpath-api-url`: The base API url of the SignPath API
- `signed-artifact-download-url`: The url of the signed artifact in SignPath

You can use the output parameters in the following way:
```yaml
    steps:
    - name: Print the signing request id
      run:  echo "Output [${{steps.<submit_signing_request_step_id>.outputs.signing-request-id }}]"
```
